Finite Automata:
    Highlight inacessible states (properties panel)
    Highlight useless states     (properties panel)
    Highlight nondeterminisms    (properties panel)
    Regular Expressions

Pushdown Automata:
    PDA to CFGs?
    Option to define the stack starting symbol?

Turing Machines:
    Test other TMs (build examples)

Preparation for version 1:
    Make the application resilient to deal with different model versions.

General -> Version 1.x.x
    Moore Machines?
    Mealy Machines?

Probably will not be implemented:
    Zoom-in
    Zoom-out
